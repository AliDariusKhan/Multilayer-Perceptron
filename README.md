This is my implementation of a multilayer perceptron, using only NumPy. In the Jupyter Notebook, I begin by establishing the notation, defining the architecture of the multilayer perceptron and then I derive the equations for backpropagation. This derivation assumes knowledge of linear algebra using index notation, probability and multivariable calculus.
